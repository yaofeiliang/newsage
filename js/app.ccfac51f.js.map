下面的问答涵盖了机制和规则、操作和建议、开发和运行等方面，帮助您选择和操作。`},\n      {TITLE:`2.Newsage与传统数字资产、直销矩阵有什么不同？`,BODY:`\n      Newsage是全球首款财富创造和分享系统。\n      与传统数字资产、直销矩阵不同，Newsage开发和运行的目的：永续创造财富并与所有参与者分享。因此，Newsage有着以下与传统模式迥异的机制：\n      针对所有购币、挖矿的投资者的财富创造机制（通过NETO通证铸造生成财富）和通证恒涨机制（通过铸造后超额回购注销推升币价）。\n      针对率先注册购买会员的数字矩阵分享机制（高层级分享低层级的购买、先到者分享后来者的购买）；针对后续注册购买会员的递增挖矿机制（后来者挖矿获得NETO通证奖励）；以及针对末位和靠近末位会员的末位大奖机制（一轮结束，最后的购买者赢得大奖且所有会员按倒序获挖矿奖励）。\n      针对合作伙伴的团队排名抢位机制（最大的合作伙伴在下一轮赢得头部ID=1）。\n      所有这些机制以智能合约形式在以太坊区块上永续运行，源源不断为会员创造财富。`},\n      {TITLE:`3.Newtoken通证（NETO）是什么？为什么会恒定上涨？`,BODY:`\n      Newsage拥有一套完整的财富创造和分享机制，这些机制的基础就是Newtoken通证，代码为NETO。\n      NETO通证的铸造主要有两个途径，一是倒计时开始前的挖矿，即每次购买，平台都会根据购买金额和总进度百分比给予购买者NETO通证奖励；二是末位大奖，即每一轮结束后，平台会给予最后一个投注、以及按投注的倒序给予所有投注者以NETO通证奖励。\n      关键在于，平台在NETO通证铸造发放后即实施铸造金额1.667倍的回购和注销，鉴于发行和回购注销的价格锚定物均为Uniswap上的NETO-ETH币对，因此整个过程均会造成NETO通缩、推动币价上涨、从而让持币人获益的。\n      因此，Newtoken通证（NETO）交易价格在算法驱动下一定是长期恒定上涨的，它是针对所有购币、挖矿的会员和投资者的财富加速器。`},\n      {TITLE:`4.怎样获得NETO通证？`,BODY:`\n      持有Newsage的NETO通证是一种低风险和高回报的投资模式。\n      获得NETO通证有两种途径：\n      其一是点击“购币”直接在Uniswap上输入合约地址购买（为防止假币诈骗，不建议输入通证名称搜索购买）。\n      其二就是参与Newsage，通过购买挖矿、或钻石挖矿、或末位大奖获得。请注意，在倒计时开始之前，选择任意X3或X4矩阵的任意层级购买，平台即按照购买金额最高13.2%比例将挖矿奖励NETO通证划转到购买的钱包地址中；但是，倒计时开始后，所有购买则不再有挖矿奖励了。`},\n      {TITLE:`5.Newsage的分享规则是怎样的？`,BODY:`\n      Newsage的会员分享采用精密的数字矩阵分享规则。它模拟了X3和X4两个矩阵、且每个矩阵都有12个层级；在X3矩阵中，每个层级有3个位置；在X4矩阵中，每个层级有4个位置。会员可选择任何一个矩阵、任何一个层级由低到高的逐级购买；但当某个矩阵已满时，平台将自动打开一个相同类型的新矩阵；每个层级的购买费用正好是前一个层级的2倍，并且您也可以从后续会员购买中获得2倍的收入。\n所有会员根据注册的前后次序排序并给于唯一ID（推荐码），后续会员购买金额的67%将在层级较高的位置和排位靠前的会员中分享。\n`},\n      {TITLE:`6.怎样参与Newsage并且获利？`,BODY:`\n      两种参与方式均可获得收益：一、注册购买Newsage，二、投资买卖NETO通证。\n方式一注册购买，点击页面上方左侧的“注册”、进入自己的钱包进行授权、然后跳转登录界面进行购买。需要注意的是：①需要提前注册Matemask钱包并购入以太币（购买时需要支付Gas费用，一般约0.02ETH）。②每次购买同样要向以太坊公链支付智能合约运行的Gas费用（约0.05ETH），如果每次购买金额过低将不划算。\n方式二投资购买通证，点击页面上方中间的购买、进入自己的钱包，然后点击Uniswap、输入（粘贴）NETO-ETH币对的合约地址******，即可买卖NETO通证。\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`7.怎样判断和选择最好的时机以获利？`,BODY:`\n      即刻参与，任何阶段在Newsage都有获利良机。\n会员通过查看实时数据和提示，结合自己的判断做出购买或投资组合。具体的，一个轮次可以分为倒计时前、倒计时后两个阶段，前阶段又分为创世、初始、上升和成熟四步。会员登录后可以看到本轮进展情况，并在不同阶段侧重不同的购买技巧。\n在倒计时之前，平台给出的参考数据，其中较为重要的：\n①进度：现总购买额除以倒计时截止额的百分比；向您标识出与倒计时的距离、以及自己在本轮中的大致位置。\n②挖矿奖励比：现阶段会员挖矿收入（NETO通证金额）除以本次购买金额的百分比，最高可到13.2%；向您标识出购买后即可获得的NETO通证金额。\n③团队排名：通过输入邀请码注册的会员与该邀请码会员互为合作伙伴关系，所有具有合作伙伴关系的会员为一个团队。平台将每个独立团队的所有会员的购买额相加，由大到小排序；向您标识出次轮您所在团队作为头部位置（ID=1）的可能性（排名第一的团队的第一位会员将占据次轮的头部位置）。\n在倒计时之后，平台增加的参考数据，其中较为重要的：\n①倒计时：进入倒计时后，最后一个购买后距离结束的时间；向您标识出可能赢取末位大奖的可能性。\n②末位大奖总金额（预测）：截止当前时刻，奖金池中归属末位大奖的总金额。\n③钻石雨预警：一轮结束约12小时后，平台启动回购和注销操作，此时对所有登录用户给出该提醒。\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`8.如果我从没交易过虚拟币，那么一切从哪里开始呢？`,BODY:`\n      人类社会正在进入数字资产时代，交易虚拟币是必由之路。\n您首先需要注册钱包并购入加密货币（如ETH），而如imToken、Tokenpocket等钱包都有以法定货币交换虚拟货币的OTC业务，它们都是为普通用户设计的，具有友好的交互界面和便捷操作。建议您动手之前，先从网上搜索观看相关钱包注册、私钥保存和换币交易的教学视频，透彻了解和掌握流程和注意事项之后再进行操作。\n重点提醒：①钱包的私钥是加密货币唯一的持有凭证，注册钱包后要立即妥善保管好（建议不要用手机拍照、截屏等方式保存私钥，最好采用手写抄录多份纸质保存）。②OTC（场外交易）换币业务在某些国家是受限具有一定风险的。\n\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`9.注册以后，如何进行购买和复投？`,BODY:`\n      倒计时前和倒计时后的获利模式不同，因此可以考虑不同的购买和复投。\n倒计时前，购买同时兼顾NETO通证买入：创世阶段可两个矩阵均衡投入，赢取后续会员分享；初始阶段购入部分NETO通证等待超额回购注销上涨；上升阶段如下线会员多则多买X3矩阵，反之多买X4矩阵；成熟阶段挖矿收益率将超过13%，兼顾购买挖矿、通证购买。\n倒计时后，NETO通证买入同时兼顾购买：进入倒计时，本轮购买就要临近尾声了，考虑到一轮结束后超额回购注销造成的通证价格拉升，可以适当买入；同时，末位大奖是一笔非常诱人的奖励，其金额约在总购买额的5-10%，在倒计时开始后，关注倒计时时长，适时购买有可能赢得末位大奖。\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`10.如何查看盈利金额？我需要从Newsage提款吗？`,BODY:`\n      注册后登录进入的操作界面上，包括本轮的购买、收入（ETH和NETO）和盈利数据都实时展示。\n您不需要任何提款操作，所有的购买分享、挖矿收入、末位大奖、挖矿钻石等，Newsage都实时划转到您的钱包地址。您可以点击查看，且只有您可以使用自己的钱包。\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`11.如何在下一轮中抢占头部位置（ID=1）？`,BODY:`\n      平台将次轮的头部位置奖励给排名第一的团队的首位会员。\n具体的，注册时在“我与推荐ID是否团队关系？”选择“是”的会员之间构成团队关系，所有团队成员的购买额合计排名，本轮结束后，排名第一的团队首位注册人（钱包地址）将自动作为下一轮的头部（ID=1）。\n特别对于有合作伙伴关系的团队而言，最初加入的合伙人务必在选项中勾选“否”，而团队的其他人，均必须手动填写自己合伙人的推荐码、勾选“是”。你在团队所处的位置和团队合伙人数，以及所在团队总购买额的排名，将实时显示出来。\n这里划重点：务必让你的合伙人在注册时填写你的推荐码（ID）并勾选“是”。\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`12.怎样挖矿？各类收益怎么计算呢？`,BODY:`\n      平台针对倒计时前的投注，按照递增比例给予挖矿奖励，计算公式为：挖矿NETO通证奖励金额=本次购买额*13.2%*总进度百分比，因此只要在矩阵中购买任何席位都将获得挖矿奖励。\nNewsage平台共有四种收益，分别为：矩阵分享收益、挖矿收益、末位大奖收益和钻石挖矿收益，每种收益都有单独的计算方法和公式。\n为了给您以简单和直观的参考，平台提供了“模拟一下”的功能，您只需要输入拟购买金额（不能超过28ETH）、点击“模拟一下”，平台就将各项收益数据更新在“我的数据仪表盘”上了。\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`13.倒计时开始后，如何操作才能赢得末位大奖？`,BODY:`\n      平台重奖最末位的购买会员。进入倒计时后，每一个购买之后即开始倒计时，如果倒计时的减少为0还没有新的购买，则该购买会员赢得末位大奖，并与其他会员按投注的倒序共同分享奖金池剩余的所有奖金。\n具体计算方法：\n所有投注均按如下方式赋予权重：第1个投注权重为3*0.75、第2个为4*0.75、第3个为5*0.75...依次类推，则倒数第2个投注为N*0.75，最后一个投注的权重定义为（3+N）*（N-3+1）/2*0.25\n*注：最后一注权重大致为全部投注权重之和的25%\n再分五步计算出各个投注所得到的NETO通证金额：\n第一步，依次将投注金额乘以投注权重。即第1个投注金额乘以投注权重、再将第2个第3个...一直到最后一个投注金额乘以投注权重。\n第二步，再将以上所有乘积求和。\n第三步，计算出末位大奖的总NETO通证数，即末位大奖总金额*60%\n第四步，用末位大奖的总NETO通证数，除以第二步得出的和。\n第五步，第四步所得的商乘以每个投注的投注金额、再乘以其投注权重，得到的乘积即为该投注的末位大奖的NETO通证金额。\n按以上计算结果铸造、发放NETO通证。\n另外，每次购买后的倒计时时长的计算方式为：第（N+1）次倒计时时长=第N次倒计时时长-1S，第1次倒计时时长按照1800S计，倒计时时长最小为180S。\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`14.怎么知道下一轮什么时候开始？`,BODY:`\n      在次轮中抢占靠近头部（ID=1）的位置，将获得较多后续位置会员的购买分享。\n了解次轮开启的时间很简单，就是紧盯倒计时的时长，当倒计时时长缩短到180秒也就是3分钟之后，基本上离本轮结束就不会太久了（甚至此时你也可以复投试试运气），当平台提示本轮购买结束时，就可以马上进行购买了。\n当然，即使倒计时时长仅为120秒也可能持续很长时间才能决出末轮大奖、从而重启次轮购买。\n      `},\n

TITLE:`common problem`,\n    LIST:[\n      {TITLE:`1. What is Newsage?`,BODY:`\n      Newsage is your inexhaustible wealth generator.\n       It is a digital token system that is built on Ethereum, through multiple rounds and perpetual operation of smart contracts, allowing most participants to profit, and constantly rising in casting, trading and destruction.\n       In other words, Newsage takes into account the interests of most members, such as first come, last come, etc.\n       If you are not greedy, you can make a profit.\n       The following questions and answers cover the mechanisms and rules, operations and suggestions, development and operation, etc., to help you choose and operate.\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`2. What is the difference between Newsage and traditional digital assets and direct selling matrix?`,BODY:`\n      Newsage is the world's first wealth creation and sharing system.\n      Different from traditional digital assets and direct selling matrix, the purpose of Newsage's development and operation is to create wealth forever and share it with all participants. Therefore, Newsage has the following mechanisms that are very different from the traditional model:\n      Wealth creation mechanism (to generate wealth through NETO token casting) and constant increase mechanism (to increase the price of tokens through excess repurchase and cancellation after casting) for all investors who purchase coins and mine.\n      Digital matrix sharing mechanism for members who are the first to register to purchase (high-level sharing of low-level purchases, first-comers to share purchases of latecomers); incremental mining mechanism for members who register for subsequent purchases (late-comers will receive NETO token rewards for mining) ; And the last prize mechanism for the last and near-last members (at the end of the round, the last buyer wins the grand prize and all members receive mining rewards in reverse order).\n      Team ranking mechanism for partners (the largest partner will win the head ID=1 in the next round).\n      All these mechanisms operate continuously on the Ethereum block in the form of smart contracts, continuously creating wealth for members.\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`3. What is Newtoken (NETO)? Why does it keep rising?`,BODY:`\n      Newsage has a complete set of wealth creation and sharing mechanisms. The basis of these mechanisms is the Newtoken certificate, coded as NETO.\n       There are two main ways for the casting of NETO tokens. One is mining before the countdown starts, that is, for each purchase, the platform will reward the purchaser with NETO tokens based on the purchase amount and the total progress percentage; the second is the last prize, which is every time After the end of the round, the platform will give the last bet and reward all bettors with NETO tokens in the reverse order of the bet.\n       The key is that the platform will implement the repurchase and cancellation of 1.667 times the minted amount after the issuance of the NETO token. Since the price anchors for the issuance and repurchase cancellation are all NETO-ETH currency pairs on Uniswap, the entire process will be Causes NETO deflation, promotes the rise of currency prices, and thus benefits the holders of the currency.\n       Therefore, the trading price of Newtoken (NETO) must be constantly rising for a long time under the algorithmic drive. It is a wealth accelerator for all members and investors who buy coins and mine.\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`4. How to get NETO token?`,BODY:`\n      Holding Newsage's NETO token is a low-risk and high-return investment model.\n       There are two ways to obtain NETO token:\n       One is to click \"Buy Coins\" to directly enter the contract address on Uniswap to purchase (to prevent counterfeit currency fraud, it is not recommended to enter the token name to search for purchase).\n       The second is to participate in Newsage, through purchase mining, or diamond mining, or the last prize. Please note that before the countdown starts, if you choose any level of X3 or X4 matrix to purchase, the platform will transfer the mining reward NETO tokens to the purchased wallet address according to the maximum 13.2% of the purchase amount; however, after the countdown starts, All purchases will no longer have mining rewards.\n       `},\n      {TITLE:`5. What are the sharing rules of Newsage?`,BODY:`\n      Newsage's member sharing adopts sophisticated digital matrix sharing rules. It simulates two matrices X3 and X4, and each matrix has 12 levels; in the X3 matrix, each level has 3 positions; in the X4 matrix, each level has 4 positions. Members can choose any matrix and any level to purchase from low to high; but when a matrix is full, the platform will automatically open a new matrix of the same type; the purchase cost of each level is exactly the previous level And you can get twice the income from subsequent member purchases.\nAll members are sorted according to the order of registration and given a unique ID (recommendation code), and 67% of the purchase amount of subsequent members will be shared among the members with higher ranks and higher rankings.\n`},\n      {TITLE:`6.

It should be noted that: ① It is necessary to register the Matemask wallet in advance to purchase Ether (Gas fee is required when purchasing, generally about 0.02ETH). ②Each purchase also has to pay the gas fee (about 0.05ETH) for the operation of the smart contract to the Ethereum public chain. If the purchase amount is too low, it will not be cost-effective.\nThe second method is to invest and purchase tokens, click Buy in the middle of the top of the page, enter your wallet, then click Uniswap, enter (paste) the contract address of the NETO-ETH currency pair******, you can buy and sell NETO tokens.\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`7.

How to purchase and reinvest after registration?`,BODY:`\n      The profit model before and after the countdown is different, so different purchases and reinvestments can be considered.\n      Before the countdown, purchase while taking into account the purchase of NETO tokens: two matrices can be balanced in the creation stage to win follow-up members to share; some NETO tokens purchased in the initial stage wait for excess repurchase to cancel and increase; in the rising stage Buy more X3 matrices, and vice versa; buy more X4 matrices; the mining yield in the mature stage will exceed 13%, taking into account the purchase of mining and token purchase.\n      After the countdown, the purchase of NETO tokens will also take into account the purchase: entering the countdown, this round of purchase is coming to an end, considering the increase in the price of the token caused by the cancellation of excess repurchase after the end of the round, it can be bought appropriately; at the same time, at the end The grand prize is a very attractive reward, and its amount is about 5-10% of the total purchase amount. After the countdown starts, pay attention to the length of the countdown, and purchase in time may win the last prize. \n      `},\n      {TITLE:`10. How to check the profit amount?

You can click to view, and only you can use your wallet.\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`11. How to grab the head position (ID=1) in the next round?`,BODY:`\n      The platform rewards the first member of the first-ranked team with the head position in the second round.\nSpecifically, during registration, members who selected \"Is a team relationship with the referral ID?\" formed a team relationship, and the total purchase amount of all team members was ranked. After this round, the first registrant of the team ranked first (Wallet address) will automatically be the head of the next round (ID=1).\nEspecially for a team with a partnership relationship, the initial partner must check \"No\" in the options, and the rest of the team must manually fill in their partner's recommendation code and check \"Yes\". Your position in the team and the number of team partners, as well as the ranking of the team's total purchases, will be displayed in real time.\nHere is the key point: be sure to let your partner fill in your referral code (ID) and check \"Yes\" when registering.\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`12. How to mine? How to calculate various types of income?`,BODY:`\n      For the betting before the countdown, the platform will give mining rewards in an increasing proportion. The calculation formula is: Mining NETO token reward amount = this purchase amount * 13.2% * total progress percentage, so as long as you buy any seat in the matrix, you will get Mining rewards.\nThe Newsage platform has four kinds of income, namely: matrix sharing income, mining income, final prize income and diamond mining income. Each income has its own calculation method and formula.\nIn order to give you a simple and intuitive reference, the platform provides a \"simulate\" function. You only need to enter the amount you plan to purchase (not more than 28ETH), click \"simulate\", and the platform will update the various income data in the \"I Data Dashboard\" is up.\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`13. After the countdown starts, how can I win the final prize?`,BODY:`\n      The platform rewards the last purchase member. After entering the countdown, the countdown starts after each purchase. If the countdown is reduced to 0 and no new purchases are made, the purchasing member wins the last prize and shares all the remaining prize pool with other members in the reverse order of betting.\nSpecific calculation method:\nAll bets are weighted as follows: the first bet has a weight of 3*0.75, the second bet is 4*0.75, the third is 5*0.75... and so on, the penultimate bet is N*0.75 , The weight of the last bet is defined as (3+N)*(N-3+1)/2*0.25\n*Note: The weight of the last bet is roughly 25% of the sum of all betting weights\nCalculate the amount of NETO tokens obtained for each bet in five steps:\nThe first step is to sequentially multiply the bet amount by the bet weight. That is, the first bet amount is multiplied by the betting weight, and the second and third... until the last bet is multiplied by the betting weight.\nThe second step is to sum all the above products.\nThe third step is to calculate the total number of NETO tokens for the last big prize, that is, the total amount of the last big prize * 60%\nThe fourth step is to divide the total number of NETO tokens of the last big prize by the sum obtained in the second step.\nIn the fifth step, the quotient obtained in the fourth step is multiplied by the bet amount of each bet, and then multiplied by its betting weight, and the product obtained is the NETO token amount of the last prize of the bet.\nNETO tokens are cast and issued based on the above calculation results.\nIn addition, the calculation method of the countdown duration after each purchase is: the (N+1)th countdown duration = the Nth countdown duration-1S, the first countdown duration is calculated as 1800S, and the minimum countdown duration is 180S.\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`14. How do I know when the next round will start?`,BODY:`\n      In the second round, if you seize the position close to the head (ID=1), you will get more purchase shares from subsequent position members.\nIt’s very simple to understand the opening time of the second round. It is to keep an eye on the countdown time. When the countdown time is shortened to 180 seconds, which is 3 minutes, it will not be too long before the end of the round (even at this time you can also re-invest) Try your luck), when the platform prompts that the round of purchase is over, you can purchase immediately.\nOf course, even if the countdown is only 120 seconds, it may take a long time to determine the final round of prizes and restart the next round of purchases.\n      `},\n      {TITLE:`15. How to mine diamonds?`,BODY:`\n      Diamond mining is simple and highly rewarding mining, but requires a little bit of luck.\nThe platform starts diamond mining to start the repurchase and cancellation of NETO tokens 12 hours after the end of a round of purchase, and repeat it every 3 minutes, every time the tokens worth 4ETH are repurchased and cancelled, until all the tokens are in the bonus pool. The funds are exhausted.\nAfter the platform prompts \"Diamond rain ahead\", you can click \"Dig diamonds\", enter the wallet interface, and then proceed to the platform display Gas fee payment.
